# C1GamesStarterKit

Welcome to the C1 Terminal Starter Kit! The repository contains a collection of scripts and 
language-specific starter algos, to help you start your journey to develop the ultimate algo.

For more details about competitions and the game itself please check out our
[main site](https://terminal.c1games.com/rules).

## Manual Play

We recommend you familiarize yourself with the game and its strategic elements, by playing manually,
before you start your algo. Check out [the playground](https://terminal.c1games.com/playground).

## Algo Development

To run your game locally, you must install the 
[Java Development Kit 10 or above](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html),
as well as the toolchain for the algo language you will be using.

If you are running Windows, you will need Window PowerShell installed. This comes pre-installed on Windows 10.
Some windows users might need to run the following PowerShell commands in adminstrator mode (right-click the 
PowerShell icon, and click "run as administrator"):
    
    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`
    
If this doesn't work try this:
    
    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted CurrentUser`
    
If that still doesn't work, try this:
    
    `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
    
And don't forget to run the PowerShell as admin.

#### Python Requirements

Python algos require Python 3 to run. If you are running Unix (Mac OS or Linux), the command `python3` must run on 
Bash or Terminal. If you are running Windows, the command `py -3` must run on PowerShell.
   
#### Java Requirements

Java algos require the Java Development Kit, as does all local development. Java algos also require [Gradle]
(https://gradle.org/install/) for compilation.
   
## Running Algos

To run your algo locally or on our servers, or to enroll your algo in a competition, please see the [documentation 
for the Terminal command line interface in the scripts directory](https://github.com/correlation-one/AIGamesStarterKit/tree/master/scripts)
